# Ex:05_Big_Data - Application-that-stores-big-data-in-R 

## Aim:

To develop a basic interactive web application using the Shiny framework in R that demonstrates the principles of big data storage and visualization by allowing users to generate and visualize datasets dynamically.

## Requirements:

### Software & Libraries:

1. R (version â‰¥ 4.0)

2. RStudio (optional but recommended)

3. Shiny (install.packages("shiny"))

4. R base libraries

## About:

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web applications directly from R. Shiny apps have two components:

1. UI (User Interface): The front-end that users interact with.

2. Server: Contains the backend logic (processing, calculations, plotting).

This experiment focuses on creating a Shiny app that:

- Accepts numeric input from users

- Dynamically generates and visualizes data

- Simulates big data storage (e.g., generating large datasets on demand)
